# HTML-CSS-responsive-portfolio


**HTML-CSS-responsive-portfolio** is my **first frontend project**, created to build a strong foundation in **HTML, CSS, and responsive web design**.  
The project focuses on structure, layout, styling, and making a website work smoothly across different screen sizes.
